What is NVC?

NVC stands for Non Violent Communication. Primarily for making disscussion more constructive and useful, it aims to focus people twoards expressing their needs directly. There are several tenants of NVC which make it useful:
  * Observation: Seperating description from judgement 
  * Feelings: Identify that feelings are your own
  * Needs: What do you need, on a fundamental level?
  * Requests: Cognizant of the other person's feelings and needs.
  
 This description covers what non violent communication is, but using it in practice, especially with anonymous and instant communication, is difficult. This tool will suggest NVC phrasing and terms when creating digital media.
